# Data context

What is a context. The React Context exist so you don't have to pass in data manually at every level. Context is about sharing data to many components. Therefore things that belong in a context is data that is considered global like a `user` or a `cart` etc.

Popular things that is usually a context are cross cutting data like:

- theme
- cart
- user

Don't use it for everything.

##Â Creating a context
You create a context by typing the following:

```js
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
```

You need to do two things to be able to use it:

- declare a provider, this will be an outer element where you supply the data
- declare a consumer, this will be an inner element where you are able to interact with the provided data and display it or in some other way let it affect your application

The above context declares a provider by typing:

```js
<ThemeContext.Provider value='dark' >
  <ThemeContext.Consumer>
  {theme => <div>{theme}<div>} // outputs 'dark'
  </ThemeContextConsumer>
</ThemeContext>
```

Most likely the `ThemeContext.Consumer` is part of another component, like so:

```js
const ThemedButton = (props) => (
  <ThemeContext.Consumer>
  {theme => <button { ...props }>button with them: {theme}<button>} // outputs 'dark'
  </ThemeContextConsumer>
);

``` 
This leads to us being able to adjust our first code to:

```js
<ThemeContext.Provider value='dark' >
  <ThemedButton />
</ThemeContext>

```
As you can see the value from the provider is being passed down through the props and we can inside of the `ThemedButton` component access the `theme` property through the `Consumer`.

## Dynamic context
What if we want to change the provider value? One way of doing that is by having a dynamic context. We can achieve that by placing our Provider inside of a component and let its value depend on the state like so:

```js
class AnyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    theme: 'dark'
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={this.state.theme}>
        <ThemedButton />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

This will enable us to add further logic that let's us alter the theme anytime we want, like so:

```js
class AnyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    theme: 'dark',
    themes: ['light', 'dark']
  };
  
  handleSelect = (evt) => {
    this.setState({
      theme: evt.target.value
    });
  };

  render() {
    return (
        <select 
          value={this.state.theme} 
          onChange={this.handleChangedTheme} >
          {this.state.themes.map(t => <option value={t}>{t}</option>)}
        </select>
        <div>
          Selected theme: {this.state.theme}
        </div>
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={this.state.theme}>
        <select>
        {this.themes.map(t => 
          <option onChange={this.handleSelect} value={t}>{t}</option>
        )}
        </select>
        <ThemedButton />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}

```

## Updating context from a component
Let's say you want a component to be able to update the context. This is not a component containing the provider but rather a component that is a consumer. How would we do that? Well we can actually expose a method that changes the context. Take the following code:

```js
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
```

Let's change this to be an object instead:

```js
const ThemeContext = React.createContext({
  cart: void 0
});
```

Ok, so now that we have an object, let's add a method to it:

```
const ThemeContext = React.createContext({
  cart: void 0,
  addItem: () => {}
});
```

Ok, so we now have the `addItem()` method, but there is no implementation? Yes, thats correct, this is more of a prototype of what it can do. The real implementation lies in the component that contains the provider. Let's create such a component: 

```

const CartPage = () => (
  <CartContext.Consumer>
  {({cart, addItem}) => cart.map(item => <div>{item}</div>)}
  </CartContext.Consumer>
);

class CartProvider extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      cart: [],
      addItem: (item) => {
        this.state.cart = [ ...this.state.cart, { ...item }]
      }
    }
  }
  
  render() {
    return (
      <CartContext.Provider value={this.state}>
        <CartPage />
      </CartContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
```

## Higher order component
Sometimes a context needs to be provided in many places. In our example above imagine the `cart` being used inside of a header that wants to show how many items you have in a `cart`. There might also be dedicated cart page where you can see the `cart` content more in detail. It might get tedious to have to wrap all those component content in a Consumer tag. For those situations it's better to use a HOC, higher order component. This means we can create a function where we use our component as input and we transfer the context into it. It can look like the following:

```
export const withCart = (Component) => {
  return function fn(props) {
    return (
      <CartContext.Consumer>
        {(context) => <Component {...props} {...context} /> }
      </CartContext.Consumer>
    );
  };
};
```
As you can see above, we are using a Consumer to make this happen but we also use the spread parameter `{...context}` to transfer what is in the context object to the underlying component. Now we can easily use this function to decorate our component, like so:

```
class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { cart } = this.props;
    return (
      {cart.length === ? 
      <div>Empty cart</div> :
      <div>Items in cart: ({cart.length})</div>
      }
            
    );
  }
}

const HeaderWithCart = withCart(Header);
```
