#Â Reducer
A reducer is a function that is able to process our message, our [Action](/redux/actions.md). A reducer takes the existing state and applies the message on it. The end result is a new state. A reducer typically operates on a slice of state.

## Defining a reducer

A reducer typically looks like this:

```js
function reducer(state = [], action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'CREATE_ITEM':
      return [ ...state, { ... action.payload}];
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      return state.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload.id);
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Using the reducer is done by invoking it:

```js
let id = 1;
const actionCreator = (title) =>  ({ type: 'CREATE_ITEM', payload: { id: counter++, title } })

let state = reducer([], actionCreator('item1'));
// [{ title: 'item1' }]

state = reducer([], actionCreator('item2'));
// [{ title: 'item1' }, { title: 'item2' }]
```

What we can see above is how we can use the reducer and take initial state, and apply an action to it. We also see how we can take an existing state and another action and simply create a new state which consists of the `old state + action`.
