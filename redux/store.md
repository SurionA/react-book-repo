# Store
Well this all seems well and good but how does a reducer fit in with a having a global store of data? Well reducers are used as the access point to our global state. It's a way to protect the global state if you will. If we didn't use a reducer to manage our global state then potentially anything could change and we would quickly loose control. Let's show how we can let reducers handle our global state.

Imagine that we have a function `dispatch` that is our entry point for changing the global state. Let's sketch it out:

```js
const dispatch = (action) => {
}
```
Ok, so we take to inparameters `action`. The job of `dispatch` is to take an action and make sure it finds the correct reducer and have that reducer calculate a new state. What we do we mean by the right reducer? Well here is the thing. A reducer only operates on a slice of state, it never manages the entire state. There is usually one reducer for our property of our state object. Let us show this in code:

```js
{
  list: listReducer(state.list, action),
  user: userReducer(state.user, action)
}
```
As you can see above we can connect every property of our state object with a reducer function. Of course the above isn't valid code so what we need to do is to put this in a function, like so:

```js
const calc = (state, action) => {
  return {
    list: listReducer(state.list, action),
    user: userReducer(state.user, action)
  };
}
```
Now we can connect this to our `dispatch` function like so:

```js
const dispatch = (action) => {
  state = calc(state, action);
} 
```
As you can see above we also introduce a `state` variable that is nothing more than the state of our store. It looks like this:

```js
let state = {
  list: [],
  user: void 0
}
```
Our full code so far therefore looks like this:

```js
let state = {
  list: [],
  user: void 0
}

const calc = (state, action) => {
  return {
    list: listReducer(state.list, action),
    user: userReducer(state.user, action)
  };
}

const dispatch = (action) => {
  state = calc(state, action);
}
```

Now the above is the very engine in Redux. This is how we can send a message, have it processed via a reducer and finally the state changes accordingly. There are of course other things to this like:
- ability to select a slice of state 
- notify listeners. 

## Select a slice of state
A component is not going to be interested in the entire state object but merely a slice of it. To cater to this we need a select function that has the ability to select a slice of the object. That is quite simple thing to do so let's add that to our code:

```js
const select = (fn) => {
  return fn(state);
}
```
As you can see above we give it a parameter `fn` and end up return `fn(state)` and thereby we let the input parameter decide what slice of state it wants. Let's showcase how we can call the `select` method:

```js
select((state) => state.list) // returns the list part only
select((state) => state.user) // returns the user part only
```  
##Â Notify listeners
Last but not least we need a way to communicate that our state has changed. This is easily achieved by using letting a listener subscribe, like so:

```
let listeners = [];

const subscribe = (listener) => {
  listeners.push(listener);
}
```
Then to notify all the listeners we need to call all these listeners when a change to our state happens, we need to place some code in the `dispatch`:

```js
const dispatch = (action) => {
  state = calc(state, action);
  listeners.forEach(l => l()); // calls all listeners
}
```

Ok so the full code now looks like this:

```js
// store.js

let state = {
  list: [],
  user: void 0
};

let listeners = [];

const calc = (state, action) => {
  return {
    list: listReducer(state.list, action),
    user: userReducer(state.user, action)
  };
}

const dispatch = (action) => {
  state = calc(state, action);
  listeners.forEach(l => l()); // calls all listeners
}

const subscribe = (listener) => {
  listeners.push(listener);
}


```
