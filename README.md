# React

React is a very popular choice when building a SPA. It was created by Facebook. The point of this book is to try to cover what I've learnt and hopefully make other people better in the process. Everyone benefits from us being better at using something.

If you are new to React spend some time in the basic section before moving on. It's important to know your basics \( I've learned this lesson the hard way :\) \)

The official documentation can be found at, [https://reactjs.org/](https://reactjs.org/)

Happy reading

Chris
