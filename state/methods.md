# Methods

When you build your component you are going to want to add methods to it. You are going to attach methods to different events such as `submit`, `click`, `change` etc. One thing you need to keep in mind is that React changes the name and the casing of the event like so:

* `click` becomes `onClick`
* change becomes `onChange`
* \`submit\` becomes \`onSubmit\`
